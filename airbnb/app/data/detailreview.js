      "The location and host are really the best, but I was worried about safety and cleanliness as I wasn't registered as a lodging company in Nara. Of course nothing happened!",

      "The location is so good! It was very convenient because it was right in front of Exit 1 of Gangnam Station. However, it was a high-rise building. It was a cozy place! I am willing to revisit",

      "When I enter the room, it seems to be a very attractive place with a window that can be seen right in front of my eyes. The shower and bathroom were also warm to the floor, so it wasn't cold. There are many restaurants in the shopping district under the building, and I think I was able to relax without anything missing.",

      "The location is just right and there is a separate space for luggage, so let's take a rest! The heating was good and the water pressure was strong, so it was great!! The reply was quick and he took care of the necessary parts in advance, so I didn't have to ask any questions! I want to use it the next time I travel!!",

      "The location was very close to Gangnam Station, so it was easy to move around, and there are many convenient facilities, cafes and restaurants nearby. When entering the floor, there is a door that passes through the password once again, so I felt like a safe accommodation. Even at night, there was a large floating population, so I was able to move comfortably. I loved the fact that the accommodation was very clean and had basic hair dryers, toothbrushes and razors. The outside view is nice and sunny, but the building in front is under construction, so the construction noise is very slight! The bedding and the floor were all clean and the hot water was well served. The host explained well, so it was easy to use the accommodation.",

      "First of all, the location of the hostel was near the station, so it was very good, and the inside of the hostel was smaller than expected for two people to stay, but overall it was neat. However, there was a part in the small house that was a little stuffy because it was a glass, and it was noisy from early in the morning because it was under construction right next to it..! The host's guidance message was easy to understand and friendly during check-in and check-out.",
